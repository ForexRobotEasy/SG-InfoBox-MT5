## Global Variables and Constants

- `globalVariable`: This is an example global variable that can be used to store and manipulate data throughout the program.

## Initialization Function

The `OnInit()` function is called when the program starts. This function is used to initialize necessary variables and resources. Any required setup or configuration can be done in this function.

## Deinitialization Function

The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the program is shutting down. It is used to release any allocated resources or perform any necessary cleanup.

## Tick Event Handler

The `OnTick()` function is called on each tick of the market. This is where traders can perform necessary actions and update/display trading information. This function is typically used to implement trading strategies and monitor price movements.

## Custom Functions

- `CustomFunction1()`: This function implements a specific trading function. Traders can customize this function to suit their trading strategies or requirements.
- `CustomFunction2()`: This function implements another trading function. Traders can modify this function to implement additional trading logic.

## Main Program Entry Point

The `OnStart()` function is the main entry point of the program. It contains the main program logic and is responsible for executing the necessary actions. In this code, it calls `CustomFunction1()` and `CustomFunction2()` and sets the `globalVariable` to 1 as an example of logical conclusion.

## Error Handling Function

The `OnError()` function is called when an error occurs during program execution. Traders can handle any errors that occur and take appropriate actions.

## Exception Handling Function

The `OnException()` function is called when an exception occurs during program execution. Traders can handle any exceptions that occur and perform necessary actions.
